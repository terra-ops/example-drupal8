   * This iterates over a list of the installed modules or themes and groups
   * them by project and status. A few parts of this function assume that
   * enabled modules and themes are always processed first, and if disabled
   * modules or themes are being processed (there is a setting to control if
   * disabled code should be included in the Available updates report or not),
   * those are only processed after $projects has been populated with
   * information about the enabled code. 'Hidden' modules are always ignored.
   * 'Hidden' themes are ignored only if they have no enabled sub-themes.
   * This function also records the latest change time on the .info.yml
   * files for each module or theme, which is important data which is used when
   * deciding if the available update data should be invalidated.
   *
   * @param array $projects
   *   Reference to the array of project data of what's installed on this site.
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Extension\Extension[] $list
   *   Array of data to process to add the relevant info to the $projects array.
   * @param string $project_type
   *   The kind of data in the list. Can be 'module' or 'theme'.
   * @param bool $status
   *   Boolean that controls what status (enabled or disabled) to process out of
   *   the $list and add to the $projects array.
   * @param array $additional_whitelist
   *   (optional) Array of additional elements to be collected from the .info.yml
   *   file. Defaults to array().
